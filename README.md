Here‚Äôs a polished, updated version of your README.md with a few key additions:

* Added **save/load trajectory instructions**.
* Clarified **data/ folder usage**.
* Minor formatting tweaks for clarity.

# BayesCRNInference

Bayesian inference framework for chemical reaction networks (CRNs) using MCMC.
This code supports **exact stochastic trajectory data** under **mass-action kinetics** with **discrete molecular counts**, and allows joint inference of both **network structure** and **reaction rates**.

---

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains code used in our manuscript to demonstrate Bayesian MCMC inference on stochastic CRN trajectories.

Key features:

* Inference from **exact stochastic trajectories** (not approximations).
* Models assume **mass-action kinetics** with discrete counts.
* Supports inference of both **reaction rates** and **network structure** (detecting reactions that are absent vs. very small).
* Includes reproducible **example notebooks** from the manuscript.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Jupyter
* Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` for pinned versions):

  * numpy
  * scipy
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn
  * torch

You can install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: `CRN_Simulation` is a local module included in this repository and does not need to be installed via pip.

---

### Running Examples

To reproduce results from the manuscript:

1. Open `main_examples.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells top-to-bottom.
3. To explore more detail, see individual notebooks in `examples/`.

---

### Generating and Loading Trajectories

Example trajectories are saved in the `data/` folder (create it locally if it doesn‚Äôt exist).

**Generate and save a trajectory:**

```python
from src.parsing import generate_single_trajectory, save_trajectory

time_list, state_list = generate_single_trajectory(
    rn,
    parameter_values,
    species_names,
    finalTime=120,
    minVal=5,
    maxVal=5,
    seed=42
)
save_trajectory(time_list, state_list, filename="../data/example3_trajectory.json")
```

**Load a saved trajectory:**

```python
from src.parsing import load_trajectory

time_list, state_list = load_trajectory("../data/example3_trajectory.json")
rn.plot_trajectories(time_list, state_list)
```

> **Note:** Files inside `data/` are ignored by Git to avoid syncing generated outputs.
